# Anime Quote Generator
A random anime quote generator that generates random quotes from different anime series or movies.

This generator was made as part of finishing the freeCodeCamp "Build a Random Quote Machine" Zipline challenge.

Current amount of quotes: **83**

## Interested in adding more quotes?
If you would like to contribute. Just head over to "script.js" and commit the following to the file along with quote you wish to add:

```
    anime_quote[] = {
      "quotenumber": ,
      "quotesentence": "",
      "quotecharacter": "",
      "quoteanime": ""
    }
```


Here's an example.
```
    anime_quote[15] = {
      "quotenumber": 16,
      "quotesentence": "People tend to show off their act of kindness. It is not an act of good will, it is a demand because they are expecting a word of grace as a reward.",
      "quotecharacter": "- Itoshiki Nozomu,",
      "quoteanime": " Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei"
    }
```
